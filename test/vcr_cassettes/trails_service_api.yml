        Mountain Park is located in Mesa Arizona which is basicly a Southeast suburb
        &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;of Phoenix. There are miles of two-way singletrack
        trails in the park. The &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blevins/Moon Rock loop is
        just my favorite. Once you visit this trail and get the &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br
        /&gt;park map you can spend hours exploring the park on a mountain bike. To
        get to &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the park entrance you need to find the Superstition
        Freeway which is also Hwy 60 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;which starts at I-10
        near Tempe. Head East on the Freeway and exit at Ellsworth &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br
        /&gt;road which is just past Power Road. Take Ellsworth about seven miles
        North. Look &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;for the big sign on the right for the
        entrance to Usery Mountain Park (Google map &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;coordinates
        33 D 28 M 55.73 N by 111 D 37 M 23.80 W). There is a $6 day-use fee. &lt;br
        /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to ask for a park map where you pay the fee. Follow
        the only road for 1.5 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;miles and look for the &quot;Horse
        Staging Area&quot; sign on the left. Pull in here and park &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br
        /&gt;(Google map coordinates 33 D 27 M 58.08 N by 111 D 36 M 26.31 W). In
        the &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;middle of the parking lot on the right hand edge
        (west side) is the start of a major &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;trail next to

        would have extended to Ohio if it weren''t for the railroads.  It is primarily
        flat, with a slight upgrade to Cumberland from DC.  The trail is about 183
        miles long (one way), and past Great Falls (great scenic point), there are
        water wells at intermittent trailside campsites, as well as port-a-johns.  The
        water is a little discolored, probably due to rust and iodine used to purify
        the water - it is safe to drink.  The best view I''ve ever seen from a Port-a-john
        is a the Paw Paw Tunnel, where the trail goes 3/5 miles through a mountain
        - have a light - it''s longer than it would seem, trust me.  Best times to
        go are late spring, early fall for unreal seasonal color changes - bring a
        tent, your significant other, maybe a camera, and marshmellows.  We rode the
        trail in a little over 2 days, camped trailside, bathed in the river (really
        friggin cold water), ate MRE''s.  There''s food in Cumberland, Hancock, and
        Harpers Ferry primarily - plan to take at least 3 days to really take in all
        there is to see.  Historic Harper''s Ferry, the rapids along the Potomac,
        especially at Great Falls, the museums, canal locks, historic houses, trestles,
        etc.  It''s worth it - screw Disney.  You can also purchase reading material
        dedicated to this trail - I''m not exactly a historian.  For me, it''s a great
        escape from the concrete jungle I live in.  Avoid weekends when it''s nice
        if tourists, and family scrimmage lines on the trails annoy you - up to Great
        Falls, the trail is very popular.  As you head west, watch for deer, black
        snakes.  Bring paniers, and have fun.","length":183.0,"activity_type":{"created_at":"2012-08-15T16:12:35Z","id":5,"name":"mountain

        Schermerhorn Gorge on the property offers a beautiful facet to the wooded
        area and the park''s autumn leaves attract several visitors yearly. Camping
        season is from mid-May through mid-October-- there are three yurts available
        for renting in addition to the other campsites. ATV are also allowed on the
        trails from May 1 through last Sunday in November.","length":3.0,"activity_type":{"created_at":"2012-08-15T17:31:31Z","id":6,"name":"camping","updated_at":"2012-08-15T17:31:31Z"},"thumbnail":"http://images.tripleblaze.com/2014/04/6490_107391805097_7945097_n.jpg","rank":null,"rating":4.0}]}]}'

        streams,, 6 inches deep or so,, that stretch for 100 feet or so,, muddy waters,,
        dry rocky hills to climb and some fast rolling hills to cruise on. When I

        7 and change. We go in at one spot,, and usually come out at a different point

        a fairly easy path to follow. The area has few trees but high grass and bushes
        abound. There is no established trail system so you will have to find your
        own way. The hills all look the same which makes it much simpler to become
        lost. If you do get lost listen for the distant sound of highway traffic which

        Hill is an easy system where most beginners and intermediates can practice
        their skills before tackling some of the tougher rides in the area. There
        are 2 very easy trails, the A-1 loop that only heads out .5 miles round trip,
        and the A loop that is 2.1 miles round trip.  Both of these have minimal hills
        and almost no technical sections. On the outer edges of A loop, three other
        more difficult trails begin. C Loop is just over 5 miles long and has some
        technical sections such as loose and broken rocks, as well as a few tough
        climbs.  It does have an excellent downhill section on its far eastern end.  D
        loop is also over 5 miles long, but is much easier as most of it has been
        turned into two track road due to logging in the area.  B loop is a much more
        technical 1 mile trail, that has roots, rocks, switchbacks, and a good steep
        climb if you tackle it from the east side first.  A good 1/2 day can be spent
        riding all of these trails as they interconnect.  ","length":0.0,"activity_type":{"created_at":"2012-08-15T16:12:35Z","id":5,"name":"mountain

        of the Lower Provo River, popular for trout fishing. Numerous hiking, biking,
        and horseback riding trails crisscross this beautiful mountain area, including
        North Fork and Shingle Creek Trails. ATV trails are in the vicinity.      This
        primitive campground contains single-family sites with picnic tables and fire
        rings with grills. Vault toilets, potable water, and garbage service are provided.
        Roads and parking spurs are dirt.      Mirror Lake Scenic Byway parallels
        the Lower Provo River as it snakes across a portion of the Uinta Mountains,
        leading to numerous high alpine lakes and streams, countless trails, breathtaking
        scenic viewpoints, and various campgrounds. Fishing, canoeing, hiking, backpacking,
        horseback riding, and biking are popular activities. The High Uintas Wilderness
        can be accessed via several trails along the byway.        This facility is
